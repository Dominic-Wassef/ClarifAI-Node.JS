To start a Node.js & Express.js server, you will:

First you will CD into your project folder:
cd "  "/

Then you will install Express.js & package.JSON:
npm init
npm install 
npm install express.js
npm install nodemon
npm install body-parser
touch server.js

Then you will go into package.JSON and change accordinigly:
{
  "name": "smart-brain-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express.js": "^1.0.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.14"
  }
}

After that, you will start the server by:
npm start
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Then you will log into yout postman and change the server to GET:
localhost:3000/

Root route- responds with this is working, the GET request

Sign In- This is our POST request, to get people to sign on
Sign In will either respond with success or fail

Register- POST request because we want to add the datat to the database or server. The returns will be the user object

Profile: This will return with the user ID | This will get a GET request because we want to return the user information

Image: This will be a PUT request, we are making updates to the user profile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECTING THE SERVER TO THE FRONT-END REACT APP:

When connecting the front end to a server, you will:

Go into your react folder and go into app.js and type:
 componentDidMount() {
    fetch('http://localhost:3001/')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(console.log)
  }

Run both applications on a local host and npm start:
You will most likely get an error
To fix this, you will:
npm install cors
Then in your server.js file, input:

const cors = require('cors');
---------------------------
app.use(cors())
